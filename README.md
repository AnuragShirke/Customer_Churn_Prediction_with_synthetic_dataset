# Customer_Churn_Prediction_with_synthetic_dataset
This project is an end-to-end machine learning analysis that covers dataset generation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, optimization, and evaluation. Various models were implemented and compared for their performance on a classification task.

## Project Structure

### 1. Dataset Generation
- The project begins with generating or loading a dataset for analysis. The `Faker` library is used to create synthetic data for demonstration.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA involves examining the dataset's structure, understanding variable distributions, and identifying potential data issues such as missing values.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering were performed to prepare the dataset for training.

### 4. Model Building
- A range of machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Gradient Boosting**
  - **XGBoost**

### 5. Model Optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning was applied to some models to improve their performance, using techniques such as `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- The performance of the models was assessed using metrics such as:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**
  - **AUC-ROC**

### Results Summary
The evaluation of various models provided insights into their relative performance.
